<h1> Portfolio Desktop Application </h1>
<br>

<h5> <p>This project is for displaying my college work. <br>
	 It is a desktop website which has the user clicking on an icon to open a window. <br>
	 The desktop will contain a directory which list files. <br>
	 There is a calculator application. <br>
	 The desktop also has a neat matrix letters javascript program. <br>
	 I will make an about me page to describe my general interest. <br>
	 The desktop is similar to windows and fedora. <br>
