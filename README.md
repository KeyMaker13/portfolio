This is my source code for my portfolio at (https://keymaker13.github.io/portfolio/)
I used JQuery and JavaScript. I also used bootstrap. 
I used a perl script to create a directory listing of files in javascript. 
The perl script created a javascript file that lists all the files and their locations.
