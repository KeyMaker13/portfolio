<h1> Portfolio Desktop Application </h1>
<br>

<h5> <p>
	Main file is the index.html. This is a desktop web app. The feel is similar to windows and fedora. 
	I used a perl script to create the workPage.js file. 
	This is a long term project to create other applications to play around with.
	The application has a directory that displays my college work for Java and C.
